## Context

> This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political,
> social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be
> called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is
> simply describing facts.

## Decision

### Overview

> This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full
> sentences, with active voice. "We will â€¦"

### Rationale

> This section describes some of the main arguments for the decision. It is here
> that the trade-offs are discussed and the context in which the decision was
> made is explained.

## Discussion, Counter and Comments

> A new section I, @waalge, just inserted.

### Comments

> A separate section can contain comments, future considerations, and
> counter-arguments.

### Considered Alternatives

> This section outlines the various options that were considered in response to
> the context. Alternatives should be briefly described, along with its pros and
> cons. Highlight why certain options were not chosen.

## Consequences

> This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All
> consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular
> decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of
> them affect the team and project in the future.
